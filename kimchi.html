<p>There are hundreds of different types of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients.<br>Traditionally, winter kimchi, called gimjang, was stored in large earthenware fermentation vessels, called onggi, in the ground to prevent freezing during the winter months and to keep it cool enough to slow down the fermentation process during summer months.<br>The vessels are also kept outdoors in special terraces called jangdokdae.<br>In contemporary times, household kimchi refrigerators are more commonly used.
